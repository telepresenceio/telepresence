## Telepresence: fast, realistic local development for Kubernetes microservices

Have you ever wanted the quick development cycle of local code while still having your code run within a remote Kubernetes cluster?
Telepresence allows you to run your code locally while still:

1. Giving your code access to Services in a remote Kubernetes cluster.
2. Giving your code access to cloud resources like AWS RDS or Google PubSub.
3. Allowing Kubernetes to access your code as if it were in a normal pod within the cluster.

## Quick Start

1. [Install locally](https://www.telepresence.io/reference/install) with Homebrew, apt, or dnf.

2. Run `telepresence`.

3. You now have a shell that proxies connections to Kubernetes.

For more about Telepresence, and the various options, [read the documentation](https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview).
