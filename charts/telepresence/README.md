# Telepresence

[Telepresence](https://www.getambassador.io/products/telepresence/) is a tool
that allows for local development of microservices running in a remote
Kubernetes cluster.

This chart manages the server-side components of Telepresence so that an
operations team can give limited access to the cluster for developers to work on
their services.

## Install

```sh
helm repo add datawire https://getambassador.io
helm install traffic-manager -n ambassador datawire/telepresence \
--create-namespace \
```

## Changelog

Notable chart changes are listed in the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

## License Key

Telepresence can create TCP intercepts without a license key. Creating
intercepts based on HTTP headers requires a license key from the Ambassador
Cloud.

In normal environments that have access to the public internet, the Traffic
Manager will automatically connect to the Ambassador Cloud to retrieve a license
key. If you are working in one of these environments, you can safely ignore
these settings in the chart.

If you are running in an [air gapped cluster](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/telepresence/latest/reference/cluster-config/#air-gapped-cluster),
you will need to configure the Traffic Manager to use a license key you manually
deploy to the cluster.

These notes should help clarify your options for enabling this.

* `licenseKey.create` will **always** create the `volume` and `volumeMount` for
mounting the `Secret` in the Traffic Managed

* `licenseKey.secret.name` will define the name of the `Secret` that is
mounted in the Traffic Manager, regardless of it it is created by the chart

* `licenseKey.secret.create` will create a `Secret` with
   ```
   data:
     license: {{.licenseKey.value}}
   ```

## RBAC

Telepresence requires a cluster for installation but restricted RBAC roles can
be used to give users access to create intercepts if they are not cluster
admins.

The chart gives you the ability to create these RBAC roles for your users and
give access to the entire cluster or restrict to certain namespaces.

You can also create a separate release for managing RBAC by setting
`Values.rbac.only: true`.

## Namespace-scoped traffic manager

Telepresence's Helm chart supports installing a Traffic Manager at the namespace scope.
You might want to do this if you have multiple namespaces, say representing multiple different environments, and would like their Traffic Managers to be isolated from one another.
To do this, set `managerRbac.namespaced=true` and `managerRbac.namespaces={a,b,c}` to manage namespaces `a`, `b` and `c`.

**NOTE** Do not install namespace-scoped traffic managers and a cluster-scoped traffic manager in the same cluster!

### Namespace collision detection

The Telepresence Helm chart will try to prevent namespace-scoped Traffic Managers from managing the same namespaces.
It will do this by creating a ConfigMap, called `traffic-manager-claim`, in each namespace that a given install manages.

So, for example, suppose you install one Traffic Manager to manage namespaces `a` and `b`, as:

```bash
helm install traffic-manager --namespace a datawire/telepresence --set 'managerRbac.namespaced=true' --set 'managerRbac.namespaces={a,b}'
```

You might then attempt to install another Traffic Manager to manage namespaces `b` and `c`:

```bash
helm install traffic-manager --namespace c datawire/telepresence --set 'managerRbac.namespaced=true' --set 'managerRbac.namespaces={b,c}'
```

This would fail with an error:

```
Error: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. Unable to continue with install: ConfigMap "traffic-manager-claim" in namespace "b" exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; annotation validation error: key "meta.helm.sh/release-namespace" must equal "c": current value is "a"
```

To fix this error, fix the overlap either by removing `b` from the first install, or from the second.

## Pod CIDRs

The traffic manager is responsible for keeping track of what CIDRs the cluster uses for the pods. The Telepresence client uses this
information to configure the network so that it provides access to the pods. In some cases, the traffic-manager will not be able to retrieve
this information, or will do it in a way that is inefficient. To remedy this, the strategy that the traffic manager uses can be configured
using the `podCIDRStrategy`.

|Value|Meaning|
|-----|-------|
|`auto`|First try `nodePodCIDRs` and if that fails, try `coverPodIPs`|
|`nodePodCIDRs`|Obtain the CIDRs from the`podCIDR` and `podCIDRs` of all `Node` resource specifications.|
|`coverPodIPs`|Obtain all IPs from the `podIP` and `podIPs` of all `Pod` resource statuses and calculate the CIDRs needed to cover them.|
|`environment`|Pick the CIDRs from the traffic manager's `POD_CIDRS` environment variable. Use `podCIDRs` to set that variable.|
