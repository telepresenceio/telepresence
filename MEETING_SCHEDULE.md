# Community Meeting Schedule

## Office Hours

We hold Ambassador Developer Office Hours once a week typically on Thursdays. Every four to six weeks we dedicate one session to meeting the maintainers of Telepresence.  These sessions are a way to connect in person to share updates and listen to feedback from the community.
