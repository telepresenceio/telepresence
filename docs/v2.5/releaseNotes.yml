        title: Dropped backward compatibility with versions <=2.4.4
        body: >-
          Telepresence is no longer backward compatible with versions 2.4.4 or older because the deprecated multiplexing tunnel
          functionality was removed.
      - type: change
        title: No global networking flags
        body: >-
          The global networking flags are no longer used and using them will render a deprecation warning unless they are supported by the
          command. The subcommands that support networking flags are <code>connect</code>, <code>current-cluster-id</code>,
          and <code>genyaml</code>.
      - type: bugfix

        title: Linux uses cluster.local as domain instead of search
        body: >-
          The cluster domain (typically "cluster.local") is no longer added to the DNS <code>search</code> on Linux using
          <code>systemd-resolved</code>. Instead, it is added as a <code>domain</code> so that names ending with it are routed
          to the DNS server.

      - type: feature
        title: New --http-plaintext option
        body: >-
          The flag <code>--http-plaintext</code> can be used to ensure that an intercept uses plaintext http or grpc when
          communicating with the workstation process.
        docs: reference/intercepts/#tls
      - type: feature
        title: Configure the default intercept port
        body: >-
          The port used by default in the <code>telepresence intercept</code> command (8080), can now be changed by setting
          the <code>intercept.defaultPort</code> in the <code>config.yml</code> file.

      - type: change
        title: Telepresence CI now uses Github Actions
        body: >-
          Telepresence now uses Github Actions for doing unit and integration testing. It is
          now easier for contributors to run tests on PRs since maintainers can add an
          "ok to test" label to PRs (including from forks) to run integration tests.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Check conditions before asking questions
        body: >-
          User will not be asked to log in or add ingress information when creating an intercept until a check has been
          made that the intercept is possible.
        docs: reference/intercepts/
      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix invalid log statement
        body: >-
          Telepresence will no longer log invalid: <code>"unhandled connection control message: code DIAL_OK"</code> errors.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Log errors from sshfs/sftp
        body: >-
          Output to <code>stderr</code> from the traffic-agent's <code>sftp</code> and the client's <code>sshfs</code> processes
          are properly logged as errors.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Don't use Windows path separators in workload pod template
        body: >-
          Auto installer will no longer not emit backslash separators for the <code>/tel-app-mounts</code> paths in the
          traffic-agent container spec when running on Windows.
  - version: 2.4.9
    date: "2021-12-09"
    notes:
      - type: bugfix
        title: Helm upgrade nil pointer error
        body: >-
          A helm upgrade using the <code>--reuse-values</code> flag no longer fails on a "nil pointer" error caused by a nil
          <code>telpresenceAPI</code> value.
        docs: install/helm#upgrading-the-traffic-manager

    date: "2021-12-03"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: VPN diagnostics tool
        body: >-
          There is a new subcommand, <code>test-vpn</code>, that can be used to diagnose connectivity issues with a VPN.
          See the VPN docs for more information on how to use it.

      - type: feature
        title: RESTful API service
        body: >-
          A RESTful service was added to Telepresence, both locally to the client and to the <code>traffic-agent</code> to
          help determine if messages with a set of headers should be consumed or not from a message queue where the
          intercept headers are added to the messages.

      - type: change
        title: TELEPRESENCE_LOGIN_CLIENT_ID env variable no longer used
        body: >-
          You could previously configure this value, but there was no reason to change it, so the value
          was removed.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Tunneled network connections behave more like ordinary TCP connections.
        body: >-
          When using Telepresence with an external cloud provider for extensions, those tunneled
          connections now behave more like TCP connections, especially when it comes to timeouts.
          We've also added increased testing around these types of connections.

    date: "2021-11-24"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Injector service-name annotation
        body: >-
          The agent injector now supports a new annotation, <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-service-name</code>, that can be used to set the name of the service to be intercepted.
          This will help disambiguate which service to intercept for when a workload is exposed by multiple services, such as can happen with Argo Rollouts
        docs: reference/cluster-config#service-name-annotation
      - type: feature
        title: Skip the Ingress Dialogue
        body: >-
          You can now skip the ingress dialogue by setting the ingress parameters in the corresponding flags.
        docs: reference/intercepts#skipping-the-ingress-dialogue
      - type: feature
        title: Never proxy subnets
        body: >-
          The kubeconfig extensions now support a <code>never-proxy</code> argument,
          analogous to <code>also-proxy</code>, that defines a set of subnets that
          will never be proxied via telepresence.
        docs: reference/config#neverproxy
      - type: change
        title: Daemon versions check
        body: >-
          Telepresence now checks the versions of the client and the daemons and asks the user to quit and restart if they don't match.
      - type: change
        title: No explicit DNS flushes
        body: >-
          Telepresence DNS now uses a very short TTL instead of explicitly flushing DNS by killing the <code>mDNSResponder</code> or doing <code>resolvectl flush-caches</code>
        docs: reference/routing#dns-caching
      - type: bugfix
        title: Legacy flags now work with global flags
        body: >-
          Legacy flags such as `--swap-deployment` can now be used together with global flags.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Outbound connection closing
        body: >-
          Outbound connections are now properly closed when the peer closes.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Prevent DNS recursion
        body: >-
          The DNS-resolver will trap recursive resolution attempts (may happen when the cluster runs in a docker-container on the client).
        docs: reference/routing#dns-recursion
      - type: bugfix
        title: Prevent network recursion
        body: >-
          The TUN-device will trap failed connection attempts that results in recursive calls back into the TUN-device (may happen when the
          cluster runs in a docker-container on the client).
        docs: reference/routing#connect-recursion
      - type: bugfix
        title: Traffic Manager deadlock fix
        body: >-
          The Traffic Manager no longer runs a risk of entering a deadlock when a new Traffic agent arrives.
      - type: bugfix
        title: webhookRegistry config propagation
        body: >-
          The configured <code>webhookRegistry</code> is now propagated to the webhook installer even if no <code>webhookAgentImage</code> has been set.
        docs: reference/config#images
      - type: bugfix
        title: Login refreshes expired tokens
        body: >-
          When a user's token has expired, <code> telepresence login </code>
          will prompt the user to log in again to get a new token. Previously,
          the user had to <code> telepresence quit </code> and <code> telepresence logout </code>
          to get a new token.

        title: Manually injecting Traffic Agent
        body: >-
          Telepresence now supports manually injecting the traffic-agent YAML into workload manifests.
          Use the <code>genyaml</code> command to create the sidecar YAML, then add the <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/manually-injected: "true"</code> annotation to your pods to allow Telepresence to intercept them.

        title: Telepresence help text now links to telepresence.io
        body: >-
          We now include a link to our documentation when you run <code>telepresence --help</code>. This will make it easier
          for users to find this page whether they acquire Telepresence through Brew or some other mechanism.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed bug when API server is inside CIDR range of pods/services
        body: >-
          If the API server for your kubernetes cluster had an IP that fell within the
          subnet generated from pods/services in a kubernetes cluster, it would proxy traffic
          to the API server which would result in hanging or a failed connection. We now ensure
          that the API server is explicitly not proxied.

        title: Get pod yaml with gather-logs command
        body: >-
          Adding the flag <code>--get-pod-yaml</code> to your request will get the
          pod yaml manifest for all kubernetes components you are getting logs for
          (<code> traffic-manager</code> and/or pods containing a <code>
          traffic-agent</code> container).  This flag is set to <code>false</code>
          by default.

        title: Anonymize pod name + namespace when using gather-logs command
        body: >-
          Adding the flag <code>--anonymize</code> to your command will
          anonymize your pod names + namespaces in the output file.  We replace the
          sensitive names with simple names (e.g. pod-1, namespace-2) to maintain
          relationships between the objects without exposing the real names of your
          objects. This flag is set to <code>false</code> by default.

        title: Added context and defaults to ingress questions when creating a preview URL
        body: >-
          Previously, we referred to OSI model layers when asking these questions, but this
          terminology is not commonly used. The questions now provide a clearer context for the user, along with a default answer as an example.

      - type: feature
        title: Support for intercepting headless services
        body: >-
          Intercepting headless services is now officially supported.  You can request a
          headless service on whatever port it exposes and get a response from the
          intercept. This leverages the same approach as intercepting numeric ports when
          using the mutating webhook injector, mainly requires the <code>initContainer</code>
          to have <code>NET_ADMIN</code> capabilities.
        docs: reference/intercepts/#intercepting-headless-services

      - type: change
        title: Use one tunnel per connection instead of multiplexing into one tunnel
        body: >-
          We have changed Telepresence so that it uses one tunnel per connection instead
          of multiplexing all connections into one tunnel.  This will provide substantial
          performance improvements.  Clients will still be backwards compatible with older
          managers that only support multiplexing.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Added checks for Telepresence kubernetes compatibility
        body: >-
          Telepresence currently works with Kubernetes server versions <code>1.17.0</code>
          and higher.  We have added logs in the connector and <code>traffic-manager</code>
          to let users know when they are using Telepresence with a cluster it doesn't support.
        docs: reference/cluster-config

      - type: bugfix
        title: Traffic Agent security context is now only added when necessary
        body: >-
          When creating an intercept, Telepresence will now only set the traffic agent's GID
          when strictly necessary (i.e. when using headless services or numeric ports). This mitigates
          an issue on openshift clusters where the traffic agent can fail to be created due to
          openshift's security policies banning arbitrary GIDs.

        title: Numeric ports in agent injector
        body: >-
          The agent injector now supports injecting Traffic Agents into pods that have unnamed ports.

      - type: feature
        title: New subcommand to gather logs and export into zip file
        body: >-
          Telepresence has logs for various components (the <code>
          traffic-manager</code>, <code>traffic-agents</code>, the root and
          user daemons), which are integral for understanding and debugging
          Telepresence behavior.  We have added the <code>telepresence
          gather-logs</code> command to make it simple to compile logs for
          all Telepresence components and export them in a zip file that can
          be shared to others and/or included in a github issue. For more
          information on usage, run <code>telepresence gather-logs --help

        body: >-
          Telepresence now enables you to directly configure how to get
          pod CIDRs when deploying Telepresence with the Helm chart.
          The default behavior remains the same. We've also introduced
          the ability to explicitly set what the pod CIDRs should be.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Compute pod CIDRs more efficiently
        body: >-
          When computing subnets using the pod CIDRs, the traffic-manager
          now uses less CPU cycles.

        title: Prevent busy loop in traffic-manager
        body: >-
          In some circumstances, the <code>traffic-manager</code>'s CPU
          would max out and get pinned at its limit. This required a
          shutdown or pod restart to fix. We've added some fixes
          to prevent the traffic-manager from getting into this state.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Added a fixed buffer size to TUN-device
        body: >-
          The TUN-device now has a max buffer size of 64K. This prevents the
          buffer from growing limitlessly until it receies a PSH, which could
          be a blocking operation when receiving lots of TCP-packets.

        title: Fix hanging user daemon
        body: >-
          When Telepresence encountered an issue connecting to the cluster or
          the root daemon, it could hang indefintely. It now will error correctly
          when it encounters that situation.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Improved proprietary agent connectivity
        body: >-
          To determine whether the environment cluster is air-gapped, the
          proprietary agent attempts to connect to the cloud during startup.
          To deal with a possible initial failure, the agent backs off
          and retries the connection with an increasing backoff duration.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Telepresence correctly reports intercept port conflict
        body: >-
          When creating a second intercept targetting the same local port,
          it now gives the user an informative error message. Additionally,
          it tells them which intercept is currently using that port to make
          it easier to remedy.

        title: Log rotation fix for Linux kernel 4.11+
        body: >-
          On Linux kernel 4.11 and above, the log file rotation now properly reads the
          <code>birth-time</code> of the log file. Older kernels continue to use the old behavior
          of using the <code>change-time</code> in place of the <code>birth-time</code>.

        title: Improved error messaging
        body: >-
          When Telepresence encounters an error, it tells the user where they should look for
          logs related to the error. We have refined this so that it only tells users to look
          for errors in the daemon logs for issues that are logged there.

        title: Stop resolving localhost
        body: >-
          When using the overriding DNS resolver, it will no longer apply search paths when
          resolving <code>localhost</code>, since that should be resolved on the user's machine
          instead of the cluster.

          retrieved from the <code>traffic-manager</code>.

        body: >-
          When using <code>--mount=false</code> while performing an intercept, the file system
          was still mounted.  This has been remedied so the intercept behavior respects the
          flag.

          sequentially. This resulted in slow (and failing) <code>Dial</code> calls would
          block all outbound traffic from the workstation (for up to 30 seconds). We now

          to temporarily change the log-level for the local demons, the <code>traffic-manager</code> and
          the <code>traffic-agents</code>. While the <code>logLevels</code> settings from the config will
          still be used by default, this can be helpful if you are currently experiencing an issue and
          want to have higher fidelity logs, without doing a <code>telepresence quit</code> and

        title: Updating RBAC in helm chart to fix cluster-id regression
        body: >-
          In 2.4.1, we enabled the <code>traffic-manager</code> to get the cluster ID by getting the UID
          of the default namespace. The helm chart was not updated to give the <code>traffic-manager</code>
          those permissions, which has since been fixed.  This impacted users who use licensed features of

          We now support configuring the host and port for the cloud in your <code>config.yml</code>. These
          are used when logging in to utilize features provided by an extension, and are also passed
          along as environment variables when installing the `traffic-manager`. Additionally, we
          now run our testsuite with these variables set to localhost to continue to ensure Telepresence
          is fully fuctional without depeneding on an external service. The SYSTEMA_HOST and SYSTEMA_PORT

        title: traffic-manager gets cluster ID itself instead of via environment variable

          The traffic-manager used to get the cluster ID as an environment variable when running
          <code>telepresence connnect</code> or via adding the value in the helm chart. This was
          clunky so now the traffic-manager gets the value itself as long as it has permissions

        title: Telepresence uses namespace from kubeconfig context on each call
        body: >-
          In the past, Telepresence would use whatever namespace was specified in the kubeconfig's current-context
          for the entirety of the time a user was connected to Telepresence.  This would lead to confusing behavior
          when a user changed the context in their kubeconfig and expected Telepresence to acknowledge that change.
          Telepresence now will do that and use the namespace designated by the context on each call.

        body: >-
          Some users were noticing that their intercepts would start failing after 60 seconds.
          This was because the keep idle outbound TCP connections were set to 60 seconds, which we have
          now bumped to 7200 seconds to match Linux's <code>tcp_keepalive_time</code> default.

          When a Telepresence process terminates ungracefully, it would inform users that "this usually means
          that the process has terminated ungracefully" and implied that they should remove the socket. We've
          now made it so Telepresence will automatically attempt to remove the socket upon ungraceful termination.

        title: Traffic Manager Helm Chart
        body: >-
          Telepresence now supports installing the Traffic Manager via Helm.
          This will make it easy for operators to install and configure the
          server-side components of Telepresence separately from the CLI (which
          in turn allows for better separation of permissions).

        body: >-
          As the <code>traffic-manager</code> can now be installed in any
          namespace via Helm, Telepresence can now be configured to look for the
          Traffic Manager in a namespace other than <code>ambassador</code>.

        body: >-
          Telepresence no longer automatically shuts down the old
          <code>api_version=1</code> <code>edgectl</code> daemon.  If migrating
          from such an old version of <code>edgectl</code> you must now manually
          shut down the <code>edgectl</code> daemon before running Telepresence.
          This was already the case when migrating from the newer
          <code>api_version=2</code> <code>edgectl</code>.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed error during shutdown
        body: >-
          The root daemon no longer terminates when the user daemon disconnects
          from its gRPC streams, and instead waits to be terminated by the CLI.
          This could cause problems with things not being cleaned up correctly.

          recognizes a
          <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-service-port</code>
          annotation to specify which port to intercept; bringing the

        title: Outbound Connections
        body: >-
          Outbound connections are now routed through the intercepted
          Pods which means that the connections originate from that
          Pod from the cluster's perspective.  This allows service
          meshes to correctly identify the traffic.

          Inbound connections from an intercepted agent are now
          tunneled to the manager over the existing gRPC connection,
          instead of establishing a new connection to the manager for
          each inbound connection.  This avoids interference from
          certain service mesh configurations.

          in the cluster or to create Services, as that functionality

          follow changes in the cluster.
      - type: bugfix
        title: No duplicate subnets
        body: >-
          Subnets fully covered by other subnets are now pruned

          laptop's routing table.

        title: Change in default timeout
        body: >-
          The <code>trafficManagerAPI</code> timeout default has
          changed from 5 seconds to 15 seconds, in order to facilitate
          the extended time it takes for the traffic-manager to do its

          <code>include-suffixes</code> in the cluster config are now

        title: Race condition in shutdown

          When shutting down the user-daemon or root-daemon on the
          laptop, <code>telepresence quit</code> and related commands
          no longer return early before everything is fully shut down.
          Now it can be counted on that by the time the command has
          returned that all of the side-effects on the laptop have
          been cleaned up.
