# Telepresence Release Notes
## Version 2.21.0
<Note>
	<Title type="feature" docs="https://telepresence.io/docs/reference/intercepts/container">Intercepts targeting a specific container</Title>
	<Body>-> In certain scenarios, the container owning the intercepted port differs from the container the intercept targets. This port owner's sole purpose is to route traffic from the service to the intended container, often using a direct localhost connection.
This commit introduces a `--container <name>` option to the intercept command. While this option doesn't influence the port selection, it guarantees that the environment variables and mounts propagated to the client originate from the specified container. Additionally, if the `--replace` option is used, it ensures that this container is replaced.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Allow comma separated list of daemons for the gather-logs command.</Title>
	<Body>-> The name of the `telepresence gather-logs` flag `--daemons` suggests that the argument can contain more than one daemon, but prior to this fix, it couldn't. It is now possible to use a comma separated list, e.g. `telepresence gather-logs --daemons root,user`.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.20.0 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(October  3)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add timestamp to telepresence_logs.zip filename.</Title>
	<Body>Telepresence is now capable of easily find telepresence gather-logs by certain timestamp.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature" docs="https://telepresence.io/docs/reference/intercepts/cli#intercepting-without-a-service">Enable intercepts of workloads that have no service.</Title>
	<Body>Telepresence is now capable of intercepting workloads that have no associated service. The intercept will then target container port instead of a service port. The new behavior is enabled by adding a <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-container-ports</code> annotation where the value is a comma separated list of port identifiers consisting of either the name or the port number of a container port, optionally suffixed with `/TCP` or `/UDP`.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature" docs="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/telepresence-oss/telepresence-oss">Publish the OSS version of the telepresence Helm chart</Title>
	<Body>The OSS version of the telepresence helm chart is now available at ghcr.io/telepresenceio/telepresence-oss, and can be installed using the command:<br/> <code>helm install traffic-manager oci://ghcr.io/telepresenceio/telepresence-oss --namespace ambassador --version 2.20.0</code> The chart documentation is published at <a href="https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/telepresence-oss/telepresence-oss">ArtifactHUB</a>.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature" docs="https://telepresence.io/docs/reference/environment">Control the syntax of the environment file created with the intercept flag --env-file</Title>
	<Body>A new <code>--env-syntax &lt;syntax&gt;</code> was introduced to allow control over the syntax of the file created when using the intercept flag <code>--env-file &lt;file&gt;</code>. Valid syntaxes are &quot;docker&quot;, &quot;compose&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;csh&quot;, &quot;cmd&quot;, and &quot;ps&quot;; where &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;csh&quot;, and &quot;ps&quot; can be suffixed with &quot;:export&quot;.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add support for Argo Rollout workloads.</Title>
	<Body>Telepresence now has an opt-in support for Argo Rollout workloads. The behavior is controlled by `workloads.argoRollouts.enabled` Helm chart value. It is recommended to set the following annotation <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-traffic-agent: enabled</code> to avoid creation of unwanted revisions.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Enable intercepts of containers that bind to podIP</Title>
	<Body>In previous versions, the traffic-agent would route traffic to localhost during periods when an intercept wasn't active. This made it impossible for an application to bind to the pod's IP, and it also meant that service meshes binding to the podIP would get bypassed, both during and after an intercept had been made. This is now changed, so that the traffic-agent instead forwards non intercepted requests to the pod's IP, thereby enabling the application to either bind to localhost or to that IP.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Use ghcr.io/telepresenceio instead of docker.io/datawire for OSS images and the telemount Docker volume plugin.</Title>
	<Body>All OSS telepresence images and the telemount Docker plugin are now published at the public registry ghcr.io/telepresenceio and all references from the client and traffic-manager has been updated to use this registry instead of the one at docker.io/datawire.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Use nftables instead of iptables-legacy</Title>
	<Body>Some time ago, we introduced iptables-legacy because users had problems using Telepresence with Fly.io where nftables wasn't supported by the kernel. Fly.io has since fixed this, so Telepresence will now use nftables again. This in turn, ensures that modern systems that lack support iptables-legacy will work.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Root daemon wouldn't start when sudo timeout was zero.</Title>
	<Body>The root daemon refused to start when <code>sudo</code> was configured with a <code>timestamp_timeout=0</code>. This was due to logic that first requested root privileges using a sudo call, and then relied on that these privileges were cached, so that a subsequent call using <code>--non-interactive</code> was guaranteed to succeed. This logic will now instead do one single sudo call, and rely solely on sudo to print an informative prompt and start the daemon in the background.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Detect minikube network when connecting with --docker</Title>
	<Body>A <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> failed when attempting to connect to a minikube that uses a docker driver because the containerized daemon did not have access to the <code>minikube</code> docker network. Telepresence will now detect an attempt to connect to that network and attach it to the daemon container as needed.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.19.1 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(July 12)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature" docs="https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3609">Add brew support for the OSS version of Telepresence.</Title>
	<Body>The Open-Source Software version of Telepresence can now be installed using the brew formula via <code>brew install datawire/blackbird/telepresence-oss</code>.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add --create-namespace flag to the telepresence helm install command.</Title>
	<Body>A <code>--create-namespace</code> (default <code>true</code>) flag was added to the <code>telepresence helm install</code> command. No attempt will be made to create a namespace for the traffic-manager if it is explicitly set to <code>false</code>. The command will then fail if the namespace is missing.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Introduce DNS fallback on Windows.</Title>
	<Body>A <code>network.defaultDNSWithFallback</code> config option has been introduced on Windows. It will cause the DNS-resolver to fall back to the resolver that was first in the list prior to when Telepresence establishes a connection. The option is default <code>true</code> since it is believed to give the best experience but can be set to <code>false</code> to restore the old behavior.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature" docs="https://github.com/datawire/homebrew-blackbird/issues/19">Brew now supports MacOS (amd64/arm64) / Linux (amd64)</Title>
	<Body>The brew formula can now dynamically support MacOS (amd64/arm64) / Linux (amd64) in a single formula</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add ability to provide an externally-provisioned webhook secret</Title>
	<Body>Added <code>supplied</code> as a new option for <code>agentInjector.certificate.method</code>. This fully disables the generation of the Mutating Webhook's secret, allowing the chart to use the values of a pre-existing secret named <code>agentInjector.secret.name</code>. Previously, the install would fail when it attempted to create or update the externally-managed secret.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Let PTR query for DNS server return the cluster domain.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>nslookup</code> program on Windows uses a PTR query to retrieve its displayed "Server" property. This Telepresence DNS resolver will now return the cluster domain on such a query.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add scheduler name to PODs templates.</Title>
	<Body>A new Helm chart value <code>schedulerName</code> has been added. With this feature, we are able to define some particular schedulers from Kubernetes to apply some different strategies to allocate telepresence resources, including the Traffic Manager and hooks pods.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Race in traffic-agent injector when using inject annotation</Title>
	<Body>Applying multiple deployments that used the <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-traffic-agent: enabled</code> would cause a race condition, resulting in a large number of created pods that eventually had to be deleted, or sometimes in pods that didn't contain a traffic agent.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Fix configuring custom agent security context</Title>
	<Body>-> The traffic-manager helm chart will now correctly use a custom agent security context if one is provided.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.19.0 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(June 15)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Warn when an Open Source Client connects to an Enterprise Traffic Manager.</Title>
	<Body>The difference between the OSS and the Enterprise offering is not well understood, and OSS users often install a traffic-manager using the Helm chart published at getambassador.io. This Helm chart installs an enterprise traffic-manager, which is probably not what the user would expect. Telepresence will now warn when an OSS client connects to an enterprise traffic-manager and suggest switching to an enterprise client, or use <code>telepresence helm install</code> to install an OSS traffic-manager.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add scheduler name to PODs templates.</Title>
	<Body>A new Helm chart value <code>schedulerName</code> has been added. With this feature, we are able to define some particular schedulers from Kubernetes to apply some different strategies to allocate telepresence resources, including the Traffic Manager and hooks pods.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Improve traffic-manager performance in very large clusters.</Title>
	<Body>-> The traffic-manager will now use a shared-informer when keeping track of deployments. This will significantly reduce the load on the Kublet in large clusters and therefore lessen the risk for the traffic-manager being throttled, which can lead to other problems.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Kubeconfig exec authentication failure when connecting with --docker from a WSL linux host</Title>
	<Body>Clusters like Amazon EKS often use a special authentication binary that is declared in the kubeconfig using an <code>exec</code> authentication strategy. This binary is normally not available inside a container. Consequently, a modified kubeconfig is used when <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> executes, appointing a <code>kubeauth </code> binary which instead retrieves the authentication from a port on the Docker host that communicates with another process outside of Docker. This process then executes the original <code>exec</code> command to retrieve the necessary credentials.
This setup was problematic when using WSL, because even though <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> was executed on a Linux host, the Docker host available from <code>host.docker.internal</code> that the <code>kubeauth</code> connected to was the Windows host running Docker Desktop. The fix for this was to use the local IP of the default route instead of <code>host.docker.internal</code> when running under WSL..</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Fix bug in workload cache, causing endless recursion when a workload uses the same name as its owner.</Title>
	<Body>The workload cache was keyed by name and namespace, but not by kind, so a workload named the same as its owner workload would be found using the same key. This led to the workload finding itself when looking up its owner, which in turn resulted in an endless recursion when searching for the topmost owner.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">FailedScheduling events mentioning node availability considered fatal when waiting for agent to arrive.</Title>
	<Body>The traffic-manager considers some events as fatal when waiting for a traffic-agent to arrive after an injection has been initiated. This logic would trigger on events like &quot;Warning FailedScheduling 0/63 nodes are available&quot; although those events indicate a recoverable condition and kill the wait. This is now fixed so that the events are logged but the wait continues.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Improve how the traffic-manager resolves DNS when no agent is installed.</Title>
	<Body>The traffic-manager is typically installed into a namespace different from the one that clients are connected to. It's therefore important that the traffic-manager adds the client's namespace when resolving single label names in situations where there are any agents to dispatch the DNS query to.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Removal of ability import legacy artifact into Helm.</Title>
	<Body>A helm install would make attempts to find manually installed artifacts and make them managed by Helm by adding the necessary labels and annotations. This was important when the Helm chart was first introduced but is far less so today, and this legacy import was therefore removed.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix" docs="https://docs.docker.com/engine/deprecated/#container-short-id-in-network-aliases-field">Docker aliases deprecation caused failure to detect Kind cluster.</Title>
	<Body>The logic for detecting if a cluster is a local Kind cluster, and therefore needs some special attention when using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>, relied on the presence of <code>Aliases</code> in the Docker network that a Kind cluster sets up. In Docker versions from 26 and up, this value is no longer used, but the corresponding info can instead be found in the new <code>DNSNames</code> field.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix" docs="https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/2814">Include svc as a top-level domain in the DNS resolver.</Title>
	<Body>It's not uncommon that use-cases involving Kafka or other middleware use FQNs that end with &quot;svc&quot;. The core-DNS resolver in Kubernetes can resolve such names. With this bugfix, the Telepresence DNS resolver will also be able to resolve them, and thereby remove the need to add &quot;.svc&quot; to the include-suffix list.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add ability to enable/disable the mutating webhook.</Title>
	<Body>A new Helm chart boolean value <code>agentInjector.enable</code> has been added that controls the agent-injector service and its associated mutating webhook. If set to <code>false</code>, the service, the webhook, and the secrets and certificates associated with it, will no longer be installed.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add ability to mount a webhook secret.</Title>
	<Body>A new Helm chart value <code>agentInjector.certificate.accessMethod</code> which can be set to <code>watch</code> (the default) or <code>mount</code> has been added. The <code>mount</code> setting is intended for clusters with policies that prevent containers from doing a <code>get</code>, <code>list</code> or <code>watch</code> of a <code>Secret</code>, but where a latency of up to 90 seconds is acceptable between the time the secret is regenerated and the agent-injector picks it up.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Make it possible to specify ignored volume mounts using path prefix.</Title>
	<Body>Volume mounts like <code>/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io</code> are not declared in the workload. Instead, they are injected during pod-creation and their names are generated. It is now possible to ignore such mounts using a matching path prefix.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Make the telemount Docker Volume plugin configurable</Title>
	<Body>A <code>telemount</code> object was added to the <code>intercept</code> object in <code>config.yml</code> (or Helm value <code>client.intercept</code>), so that the automatic download and installation of this plugin can be fully customised.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add option to load the kubeconfig yaml from stdin during connect.</Title>
	<Body>This allows another process with a kubeconfig already loaded in memory to directly pass it to <code>telepresence connect</code> without needing a separate file. Simply use a dash "-" as the filename for the <code>--kubeconfig</code> flag.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add ability to specify agent security context.</Title>
	<Body>A new Helm chart value <code>agent.securityContext</code> that will allow configuring the security context of the injected traffic agent.  The value can be set to a valid Kubernetes securityContext object, or can be set to an empty value (<code>{}</code>) to ensure the agent has no defined security context.  If no value is specified, the traffic manager will set the agent's security context to the same as the first container's of the workload being injected into.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Tracing is no longer enabled by default.</Title>
	<Body>Tracing must now be enabled explicitly in order to use the <code>telepresence gather-traces</code> command.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Removal of timeouts that are no longer in use</Title>
	<Body>The <code>config.yml</code> values <code>timeouts.agentInstall</code> and <code>timeouts.apply</code> haven't been in use since versions prior to 2.6.0, when the client was responsible for installing the traffic-agent. These timeouts are now removed from the code-base, and a warning will be printed when attempts are made to use them.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Search all private subnets to find one open for dnsServerSubnet</Title>
	<Body>This resolves a bug that did not test all subnets in a private range, sometimes resulting in the warning, "DNS doesn't seem to work properly."</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Docker aliases deprecation caused failure to detect Kind cluster.</Title>
	<Body>The logic for detecting if a cluster is a local Kind cluster, and therefore needs some special attention when using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>, relied on the presence of <code>Aliases</code> in the Docker network that a Kind cluster sets up. In Docker versions from 26 and up, this value is no longer used, but the corresponding info can instead be found in the new <code>DNSNames</code> field.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Creation of individual pods was blocked by the agent-injector webhook.</Title>
	<Body>An attempt to create a pod was blocked unless it was provided by a workload. Hence, commands like <code>kubectl run -i busybox --rm --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never -- curl echo-easy.default</code> would be blocked from executing.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Fix panic due to root daemon not running.</Title>
	<Body>If a <code>telepresence connect</code> was made at a time when the root daemon was not running (an abnormal condition) and a subsequent intercept was then made, a panic would occur when the port-forward to the agent was set up. This is now fixed so that the initial <code>telepresence connect</code> is refused unless the root daemon is running.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Get rid of telemount plugin stickiness</Title>
	<Body>The <code>datawire/telemount</code> that is automatically downloaded and installed, would never be updated once the installation was made. Telepresence will now check for the latest release of the plugin and cache the result of that check for 24 hours. If a new version arrives, it will be installed and used.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Use route instead of address for CIDRs with masks that don't allow "via"</Title>
	<Body>A CIDR with a mask that leaves less than two bits (/31 or /32 for IPv4) cannot be added as an address to the VIF, because such addresses must have bits allowing a "via" IP.
The logic was modified to allow such CIDRs to become static routes, using the VIF base address as their "via", rather than being VIF addresses in their own right.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Containerized daemon created cache files owned by root</Title>
	<Body>When using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> to create a containerized daemon, that daemon would sometimes create files in the cache that were owned by root, which then caused problems when connecting without the <code>--docker</code> flag.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Remove large number of requests when traffic-manager is used in large clusters.</Title>
	<Body>The traffic-manager would make a very large number of API requests during cluster start-up or when many services were changed for other reasons. The logic that did this was refactored and the number of queries were significantly reduced.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Don't patch probes on replaced containers.</Title>
	<Body>A container that is being replaced by a <code>telepresence intercept --replace</code> invocation will have no liveness-, readiness, nor startup-probes. Telepresence didn't take this into consideration when injecting the traffic-agent, but now it will refrain from patching symbolic port names of those probes.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Don't rely on context name when deciding if a kind cluster is used.</Title>
	<Body>The code that auto-patches the kubeconfig when connecting to a kind cluster from within a docker container, relied on the context name starting with "kind-", but although all contexts created by kind have that name, the user is still free to rename it or to create other contexts using the same connection properties. The logic was therefore changed to instead look for a loopback service address.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.18.0 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(February  9)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Include the image for the traffic-agent in the output of the version and status commands.</Title>
	<Body>The version and status commands will now output the image that the traffic-agent will be using when injected by the agent-injector.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Custom DNS using the client DNS resolver.</Title>
	<Body><p>A new <code>telepresence connect --proxy-via CIDR=WORKLOAD</code> flag was introduced, allowing Telepresence to translate DNS responses matching specific subnets into virtual IPs that are used locally. Those virtual IPs are then routed (with reverse translation) via the pod's of a given workload. This makes it possible to handle custom DNS servers that resolve domains into loopback IPs. The flag may also be used in cases where the cluster's subnets are in conflict with the workstation's VPN.</p> <p>The CIDR can also be a symbolic name that identifies a subnet or list of subnets:</p><table><tbody> <tr><td><code>also</code></td><td>All subnets added with --also-proxy</td></tr> <tr><td><code>service</code></td><td>The cluster's service subnet</td></tr> <tr><td><code>pods</code></td><td>The cluster's pod subnets.</td></tr> <tr><td><code>all</code></td><td>All of the above.</td></tr> </tbody></table></Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Ensure that agent.appProtocolStrategy is propagated correctly.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>agent.appProtocolStrategy</code> was inadvertently dropped when moving license related code fromm the OSS repository the repository for the Enterprise version of Telepresence. It has now been restored.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Include non-default zero values in output of telepresence config view.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>telepresence config view</code> command will now print zero values in the output when the default for the value is non-zero.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Restore ability to run the telepresence CLI in a docker container.</Title>
	<Body>The improvements made to be able to run the telepresence daemon in docker using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code> made it impossible to run both the CLI and the daemon in docker. This commit fixes that and also ensures that the user- and root-daemons are merged in this scenario when the container runs as root.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Remote mounts when intercepting with the --replace flag.</Title>
	<Body>A <code>telepresence intercept --replace</code> did not correctly mount all volumes, because when the intercepted container was removed, its mounts were no longer visible to the agent-injector when it was subjected to a second invocation. The container is now kept in place, but with an image that just sleeps infinitely.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Intercepting with the --replace flag will no longer require all subsequent intercepts to use --replace.</Title>
	<Body>A <code>telepresence intercept --replace</code> will no longer switch the mode of the intercepted workload, forcing all subsequent intercepts on that workload to use <code>--replace</code> until the agent is uninstalled. Instead, <code>--replace</code> can be used interchangeably just like any other intercept flag.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Kubeconfig exec authentication with context names containing colon didn't work on Windows</Title>
	<Body>The logic added to allow the root daemon to connect directly to the cluster using the user daemon as a proxy for exec type authentication in the kube-config, didn't take into account that a context name sometimes contains the colon ":" character. That character cannot be used in filenames on windows because it is the drive letter separator.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Provide agent name and tag as separate values in Helm chart</Title>
	<Body>The <code>AGENT_IMAGE</code> was a concatenation of the agent's name and tag. This is now changed so that the env instead contains an <code>AGENT_IMAGE_NAME</code> and <code>AGENT_INAGE_TAG</code>. The <code>AGENT_IMAGE </code> is removed. Also, a new env <code>REGISTRY</code> is added, where the registry of the traffic- manager image is provided. The <code>AGENT_REGISTRY</code> is no longer required and will default to <code>REGISTRY</code> if not set.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Environment interpolation expressions were prefixed twice.</Title>
	<Body>Telepresence would sometimes prefix environment interpolation expressions in the traffic-agent twice so that an expression that looked like <code>$(SOME_NAME)</code> in the app-container, ended up as <code> $(_TEL_APP_A__TEL_APP_A_SOME_NAME)</code> in the corresponding expression in the traffic-agent.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Panic in root-daemon on darwin workstations with full access to cluster network.</Title>
	<Body>A darwin machine with full access to the cluster's subnets will never create a TUN-device, and a check was missing if the device actually existed, which caused a panic in the root daemon.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Show allow-conflicting-subnets in telepresence status and telepresence config view.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>telepresence status</code> and <code>telepresence config view</code> commands didn't show the <code>allowConflictingSubnets</code> CIDRs because the value wasn't propagated correctly to the CLI.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">It is now possible use a host-based connection and containerized connections simultaneously.</Title>
	<Body>Only one host-based connection can exist because that connection will alter the DNS to reflect the namespace of the connection. but it's now possible to create additional connections using <code>--docker</code> while retaining the host-based connection.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Ability to set the hostname of a containerized daemon.</Title>
	<Body>The hostname of a containerized daemon defaults to be the container's ID in Docker. You now can override the hostname using <code>telepresence connect --docker --hostname &lt;a name&gt;</code>.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">New <code>--multi-daemon</code>flag to enforce a consistent structure for the status command output.</Title>
	<Body>The output of the <code>telepresence status</code> when using <code>--output json</code> or <code>--output yaml</code> will either show an object where the <code>user_daemon</code> and <code>root_daemon</code> are top level elements, or when multiple connections are used, an object where a <code>connections</code> list contains objects with those daemons. The flag <code>--multi-daemon</code> will enforce the latter structure even when only one daemon is connected so that the output can be parsed consistently. The reason for keeping the former structure is to retain backward compatibility with existing parsers.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Make output from telepresence quit more consistent.</Title>
	<Body>A quit (without -s) just disconnects the host user and root daemons but will quit a container based daemon. The message printed was simplified to remove some have/has is/are errors caused by the difference.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Fix &quot;tls: bad certificate&quot; errors when refreshing the mutator-webhook secret</Title>
	<Body>The <code>agent-injector</code> service will now refresh the secret used by the <code>mutator-webhook</code> each time a new connection is established, thus preventing the certificates to go out-of-sync when the secret is regenerated.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Keep telepresence-agents configmap in sync with pod states.</Title>
	<Body>An intercept attempt that resulted in a timeout due to failure of injecting the traffic-agent left the <code>telepresence-agents</code> configmap in a state that indicated that an agent had been added, which caused problems for subsequent intercepts after the problem causing the first failure had been fixed.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">The <code>telepresence status</code> command will now report the status of all running daemons.</Title>
	<Body>A <code>telepresence status</code>, issued when multiple containerized daemons were active, would error with &quot;multiple daemons are running, please select one using the --use &lt;match&gt; flag&quot;. This is now fixed so that the command instead reports the status of all running daemons.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">The <code>telepresence version</code> command will now report the version of all running daemons.</Title>
	<Body>A <code>telepresence version</code>, issued when multiple containerized daemons were active, would error with &quot;multiple daemons are running, please select one using the --use &lt;match&gt; flag&quot;. This is now fixed so that the command instead reports the version of all running daemons.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Multiple containerized daemons can now be disconnected using <code>telepresence quit -s</code></Title>
	<Body>A <code>telepresence quit -s</code>, issued when multiple containerized daemons were active, would error with &quot;multiple daemons are running, please select one using the --use &lt;match&gt; flag&quot;. This is now fixed so that the command instead quits all daemons.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">The DNS search path on Windows is now restored when Telepresence quits</Title>
	<Body>The DNS search path that Telepresence uses to simulate the DNS lookup functionality in the connected cluster namespace was not removed by a <code>telepresence quit</code>, resulting in connectivity problems from the workstation. Telepresence will now remove the entries that it has added to the search list when it quits.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">The user-daemon would sometimes get killed when used by multiple simultaneous CLI clients.</Title>
	<Body>The user-daemon would die with a fatal &quot;fatal error: concurrent map writes&quot; error in the <code>connector.log</code>, effectively killing the ongoing connection.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Multiple services ports using the same target port would not get intercepted correctly.</Title>
	<Body>Intercepts didn't work when multiple service ports were using the same container port. Telepresence would think that one of the ports wasn't intercepted and therefore disable the intercept of the container port.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Root daemon refuses to disconnect.</Title>
	<Body>The root daemon would sometimes hang forever when attempting to disconnect due to a deadlock in the VIF-device.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Fix panic in user daemon when traffic-manager was unreachable</Title>
	<Body>The user daemon would panic if the traffic-manager was unreachable. It will now instead report a proper error to the client.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Removal of backward support for versions predating 2.6.0</Title>
	<Body>The telepresence helm installer will no longer discover and convert workloads that were modified by versions prior to 2.6.0. The traffic manager will and no longer support the muxed tunnels used in versions prior to 2.5.0.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.17.0 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(November 14)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Additional Prometheus metrics to track intercept/connect activity</Title>
	<Body>This feature adds the following metrics to the Prometheus endpoint: <code>connect_count</code>, <code>connect_active_status</code>, <code>intercept_count</code>, and <code>intercept_active_status</code>. These are labeled by client/install_id. Additionally, the <code>intercept_count</code> metric has been renamed to <code>active_intercept_count</code> for clarity.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Make the Telepresence client docker image configurable.</Title>
	<Body>The docker image used when running a Telepresence intercept in docker mode can now be configured using the setting <code>images.clientImage</code> and will default first to the value of the environment <code> TELEPRESENCE_CLIENT_IMAGE</code>, and then to the value preset by the telepresence binary. This configuration setting is primarily intended for testing purposes.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Use traffic-agent port-forwards for outbound and intercepted traffic.</Title>
	<Body>The telepresence TUN-device is now capable of establishing direct port-forwards to a traffic-agent in the connected namespace. That port-forward is then used for all outbound traffic to the device, and also for all traffic that arrives from intercepted workloads. Getting rid of the extra hop via the traffic-manager improves performance and reduces the load on the traffic-manager. The feature can only be used if the client has Kubernetes port-forward permissions to the connected namespace. It can be disabled by setting <code> cluster.agentPortForward</code> to <code>false</code> in <code>config.yml</code>.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Improve outbound traffic performance.</Title>
	<Body>The root-daemon now communicates directly with the traffic-manager instead of routing all outbound traffic through the user-daemon. The root-daemon uses a patched kubeconfig where <code>exec</code> configurations to obtain credentials are dispatched to the user-daemon. This to ensure that all authentication plugins will execute in user-space. The old behavior of routing everything through the user-daemon can be restored by setting <code>cluster.connectFromRootDaemon</code> to <code>false</code> in <code>config.yml</code>.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">New networking CLI flag --allow-conflicting-subnets</Title>
	<Body>telepresence connect (and other commands that kick off a connect) now accepts an --allow-conflicting-subnets CLI flag. This is equivalent to client.routing.allowConflictingSubnets in the helm chart, but can be specified at connect time. It will be appended to any configuration pushed from the traffic manager.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Warn if large version mismatch between traffic manager and client.</Title>
	<Body>Print a warning if the minor version diff between the client and the traffic manager is greater than three.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">The authenticator binary was removed from the docker image.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>authenticator</code> binary, used when serving proxied <code>exec</code> kubeconfig credential retrieval, has been removed. The functionality was instead added as a subcommand to the <code>telepresence </code> binary.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.16.1 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(October 12)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add --docker-debug flag to the telepresence intercept command.</Title>
	<Body>This flag is similar to <code>--docker-build</code> but will start the container with more relaxed security using the <code>docker run</code> flags <code>--security-opt apparmor=unconfined --cap-add SYS_PTRACE</code>.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add a --export option to the telepresence connect command.</Title>
	<Body>In some situations it is necessary to make some ports available to the host from a containerized telepresence daemon. This commit adds a repeatable <code>--expose &lt;docker port exposure&gt;</code> flag to the connect command.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Prevent agent-injector webhook from selecting from kube-xxx namespaces.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>kube-system</code> and <code>kube-node-lease</code> namespaces should not be affected by a global agent-injector webhook by default. A default <code>namespaceSelector</code> was therefore added to the Helm Chart <code>agentInjector.webhook</code> that contains a <code>NotIn</code> preventing those namespaces from being selected.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Backward compatibility for pod template TLS annotations.</Title>
	<Body>Users of Telepresence &lt; 2.9.0 that make use of the pod template TLS annotations were unable to upgrade because the annotation names have changed (now prefixed by "telepresence."), and the environment expansion of the annotation values was dropped. This fix restores support for the old names (while retaining the new ones) and the environment expansion.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="security">Built with go 1.21.3</Title>
	<Body>Built Telepresence with go 1.21.3 to address CVEs.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Match service selector against pod template labels</Title>
	<Body>When listing intercepts (typically by calling <code>telepresence list</code>) selectors of services are matched against workloads. Previously the match was made against the labels of the workload, but now they are matched against the labels pod template of the workload. Since the service would actually be matched against pods this is more correct. The most common case when this makes a difference is that statefulsets now are listed when they should.</Body>
</Note>
## Version 2.16.0 <span style={{fontSize:'16px'}}>(October  2)</span>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">The helm sub-commands will no longer start the user daemon.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>telepresence helm install/upgrade/uninstall</code> commands will no longer start the telepresence user daemon because there's no need to connect to the traffic-manager in order for them to execute.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Routing table race condition</Title>
	<Body>A race condition would sometimes occur when a Telepresence TUN device was deleted and another created in rapid succession that caused the routing table to reference interfaces that no longer existed.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Stop lingering daemon container</Title>
	<Body>When using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>, a lingering container could be present, causing errors like &quot;The container name NN is already in use by container XX ...&quot;. When this happens, the connect logic will now give the container some time to stop and then call <code>docker stop NN</code> to stop it before retrying to start it.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="bugfix">Add file locking to the Telepresence cache</Title>
	<Body>Files in the Telepresence cache are accesses by multiple processes. The processes will now use advisory locks on the files to guarantee consistency.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Lock connection to namespace</Title>
	<Body>The behavior changed so that a connected Telepresence client is bound to a namespace. The namespace can then not be changed unless the client disconnects and reconnects. A connection is also given a name. The default name is composed from <code>&lt;kube context name&gt;-&lt;namespace&gt;</code> but can be given explicitly when connecting using <code>--name</code>. The connection can optionally be identified using the option <code>--use &lt;name match&gt;</code> (only needed when docker is used and more than one connection is active).</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Deprecation of global --context and --docker flags.</Title>
	<Body>The global flags <code>--context</code> and <code>--docker</code> will now be considered deprecated unless used with commands that accept the full set of Kubernetes flags (e.g. <code>telepresence connect</code>).</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Deprecation of the --namespace flag for the intercept command.</Title>
	<Body>The <code>--namespace</code> flag is now deprecated for <code>telepresence intercept</code> command. The flag can instead be used with all commands that accept the full set of Kubernetes flags (e.g. <code>telepresence connect</code>).</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Legacy code predating version 2.6.0 was removed.</Title>
	<Body>The telepresence code-base still contained a lot of code that would modify workloads instead of relying on the mutating webhook installer when a traffic-manager version predating version 2.6.0 was discovered. This code has now been removed.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="feature">Add `telepresence list-namespaces` and `telepresence list-contexts` commands</Title>
	<Body>These commands can be used to check accessible namespaces and for automation.</Body>
</Note>
<Note>
	<Title type="change">Implicit connect warning</Title>
	<Body>A deprecation warning will be printed if a command other than <code>telepresence connect</code> causes an implicit connect to happen. Implicit connects will be removed in a future release.</Body>
