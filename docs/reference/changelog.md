# Changelog

#### 0.73 (December 28, 2017)

Features:

* The `--also-proxy` feature supports specifying IP ranges (in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)) in addition to hostnames and individual IPs.
  ([#375](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/375))

Misc:

* Telepresence source code is no longer one giant Python file.
  This will allow for quicker development going forward.
  ([#377](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/pull/377))
* Telepresence source code conforms to `yapf` formatting.
  The lint stage of the CI pipeline enforces this.
  ([#368](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/368))

#### 0.72 (December 12, 2017)

Misc:

* The Telepresence source tree is organized more like a typical Python project.
  This will allow for quicker development going forward.
  ([#344](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/pull/344))
* Telepresence has native packages for Ubuntu Xenial, Zesty, and Artful, and for Fedora 26 and 27.
  ([#269](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/269))
* An install script is included for installing Telepresence from source.
  ([#347](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/347))
  

#### 0.71 (November 1, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Telepresence no longer crashes on deployments containing Services of type ExternalName.
  Thanks to Niko van Meurs for the patch.
  ([#324](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/pull/324),
  [#329](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/pull/329))

Misc:

* The [anonymous usage information](usage_reporting) reported by Telepresence now includes the operation (e.g., "swap-deployment") and method (e.g., "vpn-tcp") used.
  This will help us focus development resources.
* Telepresence is no longer packaged for Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety Yak) as that release has [reached end of life](http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2017/07/20/ubuntu-16-10-yakkety-yak-end-of-life-reached-on-july-20-2017/).

#### 0.68 (October 12, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Telepresence no longer crashes when the deployment has multi-line environment variables.
  ([#301](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/301))
* Telepresence now sets a CPU limit on its Kubernetes pods.
  ([#287](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/287))
* Deployments that do not use the default service account (and thus don't automatically have access to service account credentials for the k8s API) are now supported.
  Thanks to Dino Hensen for the patch.
  ([#313](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/pull/313),
  [#314](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/pull/314))

Misc

* [Telepresence documentation](https://www.telepresence.io/discussion/overview) uses GitBook.

#### 0.67 (September 21, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* The macOS Homebrew installation no longer assumes that you have Homebrew installed in the default location (`/usr/local`). It also no longer requires `virtualenv` to be installed.

Misc:

* The Telepresence logfile now has time and source stamps for almost every line. This will help us diagnose problems going forward.
* Clarified which support binaries are being looked for and where on startup.
* The website now has a [community page](https://www.telepresence.io/reference/community).
* Cleaned up some links (HTTP vs HTTPS, avoid redirection).

#### 0.65 (August 29, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Avoid a dependency conflict in the macOS Homebrew installation by dropping the required dependency on `socat`. You will still need to install `socat` if you want to use `--method container`, but installing it separately from Telepresence appears to work fine. Thanks to Dylan Scott for chasing this down.
  ([#275](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/275))

#### 0.64 (August 23, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Allow `make build-k8s-proxy-minikube` to work on macOS. Same for Minishift.
* Allow `--logfile /dev/null`

Misc:

* Documented macOS limitations with `--method inject-tcp` due to System Integrity Protection. Thanks to Dylan Scott for the detailed write-up.
  ([#268](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/268))
* The [website](https://www.telepresence.io/) has TLS enabled
* Telepresence [reports anonymous usage information](usage_reporting) during startup

#### 0.63 (July 31, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Fixed regression in `--swap-deployment` where it would add a proxy container instead of replacing the existing one.
  ([#253](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/253))

#### 0.62 (July 26, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Support for Linux distributions using systemd-resolved, like Ubuntu 17.04 and Arch, now works when there is no search domain set.
  Thanks to Vladimir Pouzanov for the bug report, testing, and useful suggestions.
  ([#242](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/242))
* Better method for bypassing DNS caching on startup, which should be more robust.
* Instead of hardcoding /16, using a better heuristic for guessing the IP range for Services.
  Thanks to Vladimir Pouzanov for the bug report.
  ([#243](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/243))
* SIGHUP now clean ups resources the same way SIGTERM and hitting Ctrl-C do.
  ([#184](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/184))

Features:

* `--method` is now optional, defaulting to "vpn-tcp", or "container" when `--docker-run` is used.
  ([#206](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/206))

#### 0.54 (June 28, 2017)

Features:

* `--method vpn-tcp` now works on minikube and minishift.
  As a result we now recommend using it as the default method.
  ([#160](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/160))

Bug fixes:

* Support more versions of Linux in container mode.
  Thanks to Henri Koski for bug report and patch.

Bug fixes:

* If no `current-context` is set in the Kubernetes config, then give a nice
  error message indicating the need for passing `--context` option to
  `telepresence`.
  Thanks to Brandon Philips for the bug report.
  ([#164](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/164))
* `oc` will not be used unless we're sure we're talking to an OpenShift server. This is useful for Kubernetes users who happen to have a `oc` binary that isn't the OpenShift client.
  Thanks to Brandon Philips for the bug report.
  ([#165](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/165))

#### 0.49 (June 7, 2017)

Features:

* **Backwards incompatible change:** Telepresence now supports a alternative to `LD_PRELOAD`, a VPN-like connection using [sshuttle](http://sshuttle.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). As a result the `telepresence` command line now has an extra required argument `--method`.
  ([#128](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/128))
* Added shortcuts for a number of the command line arguments.

#### 0.48 (May 25, 2017)

Features:

* Preliminary support for OpenShift Origin.
  Thanks to Eli Young for lots of help figuring out the necessary steps.
  ([#132](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/132))

Bug fixes:

  ([#94](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/94))

#### 0.45 (May 8, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* The Kubernetes-side container used by Telepresence no longer runs as root.
  This will make support for OpenShift Origin easier, as well as other environments that don't want containers running as root.
  Thanks to Eli Young for the patch.
* Increased connection timeout from 3 seconds to 10 seconds, in the hopes of reducing spurious disconnects.
  ([#88](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/88))

#### 0.43 (May 3, 2017)

Features:

* `--run` lets you run a command directly as an alternative to running a shell, e.g. `telepresence --new-deployment test --run python3 myapp.py`.
* `telepresence` starts up much faster by polling more frequently and reducing unnecessary sleeps.

#### 0.42 (April 28, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* `~/.bashrc` is no longer loaded by the Telepresence shell, to ensure it doesn't break when e.g. `kubectl` is run there. Thanks to discopalevo for the bug report.
  ([#126](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/126))
* Log files are written to original path, not wherever you happen to `cd` to.
  ([#120](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/120))
* Better error messages when a custom Deployment is missing or misconfigured.
  ([#121](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/121))

  Thanks to Svend Sorenson for the bug report.
  ([#97](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/97))

#### 0.26 (April 6, 2017)

Backwards incompatible changes:

* New requirements: openssh client and Python 3 must be installed for Telepresence to work.
  Docker is no longer required.

Features:

* Docker is no longer required to run Telepresence.
  ([#78](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/78))
* Local servers just have to listen on localhost (127.0.0.1) in order to be accessible to Kubernetes; previously they had to listen on all interfaces.
  ([#77](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/77))

  ([#24](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/24))

#### 0.20 (March 27, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Telepresence only copies environment variables explicitly configured in the `Deployment`, rather than copying all environment variables.
* If there is more than one container Telepresence copies the environment variables from the one running the `datawire/telepresence-k8s` image, rather than the first one.
