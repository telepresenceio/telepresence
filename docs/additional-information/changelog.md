#### 0.45 (unreleased)

Bug fixes:

* The Kubernetes-side container used by Telepresence no longer runs as root.
  This will make support for OpenShift Origin easier, as well as other environments that don't want containers running as root.
  Thanks to Eli Young for the feature request.

#### 0.44 (May 4, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* `telepresence` fails with a better error if a too-old version of Python is used.
   Thanks to Victor Gdalevich for the bug report.
   ([#136](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/136))
* `telepresence` automatic bug reporting code is triggered by errors during parsing command line arguments.
* If namespace was set using `kubectl config set-context` it will no longer cause Telepresence to break.
  Thanks to spiddy for the bug report.
  ([#133](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/133))

#### 0.43 (May 3, 2017)

Features:

* `--run` lets you run a command directly as an alternative to running a shell, e.g. `telepresence --new-deployment test --run python3 myapp.py`.
* `telepresence` starts up much faster by polling more frequently and reducing unnecessary sleeps.

#### 0.42 (April 28, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* `~/.bashrc` is no longer loaded by the Telepresence shell, to ensure it doesn't break when e.g. `kubectl` is run there. Thanks to discopalevo for the bug report.
  ([#126](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/126))
* Log files are written to original path, not wherever you happen to `cd` to.
  ([#120](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/120))
* Better error messages when a custom Deployment is missing or misconfigured.
  ([#121](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/121))

#### 0.41 (April 26, 2017)

Features:

* Telepresence can run on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Bug fixes:

* Telepresence now sets a RAM limit on its Kubernetes pods.
* Telepresence Kubernetes pod exits faster.

Releases 0.31 to 0.40 were spent debugging release automation.

Features:

  ([#97](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/97))

#### 0.26 (April 6, 2017)

Backwards incompatible changes:

* New requirements: openssh client and Python 3 must be installed for Telepresence to work.
  Docker is no longer required.

Features:

* Docker is no longer required to run Telepresence.
  ([#78](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/78))
* Local servers just have to listen on localhost (127.0.0.1) in order to be accessible to Kubernetes; previously they had to listen on all interfaces.
  ([#77](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/77))

0.25 failed the release process due to some sort of mysterious mistake.

#### 0.24 (April 5, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* The `KUBECONFIG` environment variable will now be respected, so long as it points at a path inside your home directory.
  ([#84](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/84))
* Errors on startup are noticed, fixing issues with hanging indefinitely in the "Starting proxy..." phase.
  ([#83](https://github.com/datawire/telepresence/issues/83))

#### 0.23 (April 3, 2017)

Bug fixes:

* Telepresence no longer uses lots of CPU busy-looping.

#### 0.20 (March 27, 2017)

Bug fixes:
