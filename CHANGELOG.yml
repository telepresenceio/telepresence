docTitle: Telepresence Release Notes
docDescription: >-
  Release notes for Telepresence by Ambassador Labs, a CNCF project
  that enables developers to iterate rapidly on Kubernetes
  microservices by arming them with infinite-scale development
  environments, access to instantaneous feedback loops, and highly
  customizable development environments.
items:
  - version: 2.16.2
    date: "(TBD)"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Make the Telepresence client docker image configurable.
        body: >-
          The docker image used when running a Telepresence intercept in docker mode can now be configured using
          the setting <code>images.clientImage</code> and will default first to the value of the environment <code>
          TELEPRESENCE_CLIENT_IMAGE</code>, and then to the value preset by the telepresence binary. This
          configuration setting is primarily intended for testing purposes.
      - type: feature
        title: Improve outbound traffic performance.
        body: >-
          The root-daemon now communicates directly with the traffic-manager instead of routing all outbound traffic
          through the user-daemon. The root-daemon uses a patched kubeconfig where <code>exec</code> configurations to
          obtain credentials are dispatched to the user-daemon. This to ensure that all authentication plugins will
          execute in user-space. The old behavior of routing everything through the user-daemon can be restored by
          setting <code>cluster.connectFromUserDaemon</code> to <code>true</code> in <code>config.yml</code>.
      - type: change
        title: The authenticator binary was removed from the docker image.
        body: >-
          The <code>authenticator</code> binary, used when serving proxied <code>exec</code> kubeconfig credential
          retrieval, has been removed. The functionality was instead added as a subcommand to the <code>telepresence
          </code> binary.
  - version: 2.16.1
    date: "2023-10-03"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Add <code>--docker-debug</code> flag to the <code>telepresence intercept</code> command.
        body: >-
          This flag is similar to <code>--docker-build</code> but will start the container with more relaxed security
          using the <code>docker run</code> flags <code>--security-opt apparmor=unconfined --cap-add SYS_PTRACE</code>.
      - type: feature
        title: Add a <code>--export</code> option to the <code>telepresence connect</code> command.
        body: >-
          In some situations it is necessary to make some ports available to the
          host from a containerized telepresence daemon. This commit adds a
          repeatable <code>--expose &lt;docker port exposure&gt;</code> flag to the connect
          command.
      - type: feature
        title: Prevent agent-injector webhook from selecting from kube-xxx namespaces.
        body: >-
          The <code>kube-system</code> and <code>kube-node-lease</code> namespaces should not be affected by a
          global agent-injector webhook by default. A default <code>namespaceSelector</code> was therefore added
          to the Helm Chart <code>agentInjector.webhook</code> that contains a <code>NotIn</code> preventing those
          namespaces from being selected.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Backward compatibility for pod template TLS annotations.
        body: >-
          Users of Telepresence < 2.9.0 that make use of the pod template TLS annotations were unable to upgrade because
          the annotation names have changed (now prefixed by "telepresence."), and the environment expansion of the
          annotation values was dropped. This fix restores support for the old names (while retaining the new ones) and
          the environment expansion.
      - type: security
        title: Built with go 1.21.3
        body: >-
          Built Telepresence with go 1.21.3 to address CVEs.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Match service selector against pod template labels
        body: >-
          When listing intercepts (typically by calling <code>telepresence list</code>) selectors of services are matched
          against workloads. Previously the match was made against the labels of the workload, but now they are matched
          against the labels pod template of the workload. Since the service would actually be matched against pods this
          is more correct. The most common case when this makes a difference is that statefulsets now are listed when they should.
  - version: 2.16.0
    date: "2023-10-02"
    notes:
      - type: bugfix
        title: The helm sub-commands will no longer start the user daemon.
        body: >-
          The <code>telepresence helm install/upgrade/uninstall</code> commands will no longer start the telepresence
          user daemon because there's no need to connect to the traffic-manager in order for them to execute.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Routing table race condition
        body: >-
          A race condition would sometimes occur when a Telepresence TUN device was deleted and another created in rapid
          succession that caused the routing table to reference interfaces that no longer existed.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Stop lingering daemon container
        body: >-
          When using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>, a lingering container could be present, causing errors
          like &quot;The container name NN is already in use by container XX ...&quot;. When this happens, the connect
          logic will now give the container some time to stop and then call <code>docker stop NN</code> to stop it
          before retrying to start it.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Add file locking to the Telepresence cache
        body: >-
          Files in the Telepresence cache are accesses by multiple processes. The processes will now use advisory
          locks on the files to guarantee consistency.
      - type: change
        title: Lock connection to namespace
        body: >-
          The behavior changed so that a connected Telepresence client is bound to a namespace. The namespace can then
          not be changed unless the client disconnects and reconnects. A connection is also given a name. The default
          name is composed from <code>&lt;kube context name&gt;-&lt;namespace&gt;</code> but can be given explicitly
          when connecting using <code>--name</code>. The connection can optionally be identified using the option
          <code>--use &lt;name match&gt;</code> (only needed when docker is used and more than one connection is active).
      - type: change
        title: Deprecation of global --context and --docker flags.
        body: >-
          The global flags <code>--context</code> and <code>--docker</code> will now be considered deprecated unless used
          with commands that accept the full set of Kubernetes flags (e.g. <code>telepresence connect</code>).
      - type: change
        title: Deprecation of the --namespace flag for the intercept command.
        body: >-
          The <code>--namespace</code> flag is now deprecated for <code>telepresence intercept</code> command. The flag can instead
          be used with all commands that accept the full set of Kubernetes flags (e.g. <code>telepresence connect</code>).
      - type: change
        title: Legacy code predating version 2.6.0 was removed.
        body: >-
          The telepresence code-base still contained a lot of code that would modify workloads instead of relying on
          the mutating webhook installer when a traffic-manager version predating version 2.6.0 was discovered. This
          code has now been removed.
      - type: feature
        title: Add `telepresence list-namespaces` and `telepresence list-contexts` commands
        body: >-
          These commands can be used to check accessible namespaces and for automation.
      - type: change
        title: Implicit connect warning
        body: >-
          A deprecation warning will be printed if a command other than <code>telepresence connect</code> causes an
          implicit connect to happen. Implicit connects will be removed in a future release.
  - version: 2.15.1
    date: "2023-09-06"
    notes:
      - type: security
        title: Rebuild with go 1.21.1
        body: >-
          Rebuild Telepresence with go 1.21.1 to address CVEs.
      - type: security
        title: Set security context for traffic agent
        body: >-
          Openshift users reported that the traffic agent injection was failing due to a missing security context.
  - version: 2.15.0
    date: "2023-08-29"
    notes:
      - type: security
        title: Add ASLR to telepresence binaries
        body: >-
          ASLR hardens binary sercurity against fixed memory attacks.
      - type: feature
        title: Added client builds for arm64 architecture.
        body: >-
          Updated the release workflow files in github actions to including building and publishing the client binaries for arm64 architecture.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3259
      - type: bugfix
        title: KUBECONFIG env var can now be used with the docker mode.
        body: >-
          If provided, the KUBECONFIG environment variable was passed to the kubeauth-foreground service as a parameter.
          However, since it didn't exist, the CLI was throwing an error when using <code>telepresence connect --docker</code>.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3300
      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix deadlock while watching workloads
        body: >-
          The <code>telepresence list --output json-stream</code> wasn't releasing the session's lock after being
          stopped, including with a <code>telepresence quit</code>. The user could be blocked as a result.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3298
      - type: bugfix
        title: Change json output of telepresence list command
        body: >-
          Replace deprecated info in the JSON output of the telepresence list command.
  - version: 2.14.4
    date: "2023-08-21"
    notes:
      - type: bugfix
        title: Nil pointer exception when upgrading the traffic-manager.
        body: >-
          Upgrading the traffic-manager using <code>telepresence helm upgrade</code> would sometimes
          result in a helm error message <q>executing "telepresence/templates/intercept-env-configmap.yaml"
          at <.Values.intercept.environment.excluded>: nil pointer evaluating interface {}.excluded"</q>

        title: Telepresence now use the OSS agent in its latest version by default.
        body: >-
          The traffic manager admin was forced to set it manually during the chart installation.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3271
  - version: 2.14.1
    date: "2023-07-07"
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Envoy's http idle timout is now configurable.
        body: >-
          A new <code>agent.helm.httpIdleTimeout</code> setting was added to the Helm chart that controls
          the proprietary Traffic agent's http idle timeout. The default of one hour, which in some situations
          would cause a lot of resource consuming and lingering connections, was changed to 70 seconds.
      - type: feature
        title: Add more gauges to the Traffic manager's Prometheus client.
        body: >-
          Several gauges were added to the Prometheus client to make it easier to monitor
          what the Traffic manager spends resources on.
      - type: feature
        title: Agent Pull Policy
        body: >-
          Add option to set traffic agent pull policy in helm chart.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Resource leak in the Traffic manager.
        body: >-
          Fixes a resource leak in the Traffic manager caused by lingering tunnels between the clients and
          Traffic agents. The tunnels are now closed correctly when terminated from the side that created them.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed problem setting traffic manager namespace using the kubeconfig extension.
        body: >-
          Fixes a regression introduced in version 2.10.5, making it impossible to set the traffic-manager namespace
          using the telepresence.io kubeconfig extension.

    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: DNS configuration now supports excludes and mappings.
        body: >-
          The DNS configuration now supports two new fields, excludes and mappings. The excludes field allows you to
          exclude a given list of hostnames from resolution, while the mappings field can be used to resolve a hostname with
          another.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/3172

      - type: feature
        title: Added the ability to exclude environment variables
        body: >-
          Added a new config map that can take an array of environment variables that will
          then be excluded from an intercept that retrieves the environment of a pod.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed traffic-agent backward incompatibility issue causing lack of remote mounts
        body: >-
          A traffic-agent of version 2.13.3 (or 1.13.15) would not propagate the directories under
          <code>/var/run/secrets</code> when used with a traffic manager older than 2.13.3.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed race condition causing segfaults on rare occasions when a tunnel stream timed out.
        body: >-
          A context cancellation could sometimes be trapped in a stream reader, causing it to incorrectly return
          an undefined message which in turn caused the parent reader to panic on a <code>nil</code> pointer reference.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/pull/2963

      - type: change
        title: Routing conflict reporting.
        body: >-
          Telepresence will now attempt to detect and report routing conflicts with other running VPN software on client machines.
          There is a new configuration flag that can be tweaked to allow certain CIDRs to be overridden by Telepresence.

      - type: change
        title: test-vpn command deprecated
        body: >-
          Running telepresence test-vpn will now print a deprecation warning and exit. The command will be removed in a future release.

        title: Fix mounting fail of IAM roles for service accounts web identity token
        body: >-
          The eks.amazonaws.com/serviceaccount volume injected by EKS is now exported and remotely mounted during an intercept.
        docs: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/issues/3166

      - type: bugfix
        title: Correct namespace selector for cluster versions with non-numeric characters
        body: >-
          The mutating webhook now correctly applies the namespace selector even if the cluster version contains non-numeric characters. For example, it can now handle versions such as Major:"1", Minor:"22+".
