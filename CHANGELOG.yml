        body: >-
          A new <code>agent.helm.httpIdleTimeout</code> setting was added to the Helm chart that controls

          another.

        body: >-
          A traffic-agent of version 2.13.3 (or 1.13.15) would not propagate the directories under

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed race condition causing segfaults on rare occasions when a tunnel stream timed out.
        body: >-
          A context cancellation could sometimes be trapped in a stream reader, causing it to incorrectly return
          an undefined message which in turn caused the parent reader to panic on a <code>nil</code> pointer reference.
