# This file should be placed in the folder for the version of the product that's meant to be documented. A `/release-notes` page will be automatically generated and populated at build time.
# Note that an entry needs to be added to the `doc-links.yml` file in order to surface the release notes in the table of contents.
#
# The YAML in this file should contain an array of releases (items) with the following attributes:
# - version: The (optional) version number of the release, if applicable.
# - date: The date of the release in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
# - notes: An array of noteworthy changes included in the release. Each note should have the following attributes:
#     - title: A short title of the noteworthy change.
#     - body: Two or three sentences describing the change and why it is noteworthy. This is in rich text format and may contain HTML elements.
#     - image: The URL of an image that visually represents the noteworthy change. This can be an absolute path or the name of the image file placed under the `ambassador-docs/public` folder starting with `./` (e.g., `./ambassador-example.png`).
#     - docs: The path to the documentation page where additional information can be found.
#     - type: The type of change, one of `bugfix`, `feature`, `security` or `change`.

      - title: TCP and UDP routing via Virtual Network Interface
        body: "Telepresence will now perform routing of outbound TCP and UDP traffic via a Virtual Network Interface (VIF). The VIF is a layer 3 TUN-device that exists while Telepresence is connected. It makes the subnets in the cluster available to the workstation and will also route DNS requests to the cluster and forward them to intercepted pods. This means that pods with custom DNS configuration will work as expected. Prior versions of Telepresence would use firewall rules and was only capable of routing TCP."

      - title: SSH is no longer used
        body: "All traffic between the client and the cluster is now tunneled via the traffic manager gRPC API. This means that Telepresence no longer uses ssh tunnels and that the manager no longer have an `sshd` installed. Volume mounts are still established using `sshfs` but it is now configured to communicate using the sftp-protocol directly, which means that the traffic agent also runs without `sshd`. A desired side effect of this is that the manager and agent containers no longer need a special user configuration."

      - title: Client Log Levels are Configurable.
        body: "Telepresence now supports configuring logs for the Root Daemon and the User Daemon. Controlling how much logging Telepresence generates in the daemon.log and connector.log will make it easier for users to have enhanced introspection, either for debugging or just satiating their curiosity around what's happening."

      - title: Legacy Telepresence subcommands
