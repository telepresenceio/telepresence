docDescription: >-
  Release notes for Telepresence by Ambassador Labs, a CNCF project
  that enables developers to iterate rapidly on Kubernetes
  microservices by arming them with infinite-scale development
  environments, access to instantaneous feedback loops, and highly
  customizable development environments.

changelog: https://github.com/telepresenceio/telepresence/blob/$branch$/CHANGELOG.md

items:

  - version: 2.3.7
    date: '2021-07-23'
    notes:

      - type: feature
        title: Also-proxy in telepresence status
        body: >-
          An <code>also-proxy</code> entry in the Kubernetes cluster config will
          show up in the output of the <code>telepresence status</code> command.
        docs: reference/config

      - type: feature
        title: Non-interactive telepresence login
        body: >-
          <code>telepresence login</code> now has an
          <code>--apikey=KEY</code> flag that allows for
          non-interactive logins.  This is useful for headless
          environments where launching a web-browser is impossible,
          such as cloud shells, Docker containers, or CI.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Mutating webhook injector correctly hides named ports for probes.
        body: >-
          The mutating webhook injector has been fixed to correctly rename named ports for liveness and readiness probes
        docs: reference/cluster-config

      - type: bugfix
        title: telepresence current-cluster-id crash fixed
        body: >-
          Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 that caused `telepresence current-cluster-id`
          to crash.
        docs: reference/cluster-config

      - type: bugfix
        title: Better UX around intercepts with no local process running
        body: >-
          Requests would hang indefinitely when initiating an intercept before you
          had a local process running. This has been fixed and will result in an
          <code>Empty reply from server</code> until you start a local process.
        docs: reference/intercepts

      - type: bugfix
        title: API keys no longer show as "no description"
        body: >-
          New API keys generated internally for communication with
          Ambassador Cloud no longer show up as "no description" in
          the Ambassador Cloud web UI.  Existing API keys generated by
          older versions of Telepresence will still show up this way.
        image: telepresence-2.3.7-keydesc.png

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix corruption of user-info.json
        body: >-
          Fixed a race condition that logging in and logging out
          rapidly could cause memory corruption or corruption of the
          <code>user-info.json</code> cache file used when
          authenticating with Ambassador Cloud.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Improved DNS resolver for systemd-resolved
        body: Telepresence's <code>systemd-resolved</code>-based DNS resolver is now more
          stable and in case it fails to initialize, the <code>overriding resolver</code>
          will no longer cause general DNS lookup failures when telepresence defaults to
          using it.
        docs: reference/routing#linux-systemd-resolved-resolver

      - type: bugfix
        title: Faster telepresence list command
        body: The performance of <code>telepresence list</code> has been increased
          significantly by reducing the number of calls the command makes to the cluster.
        docs: reference/client

  - version: 2.3.6
    date: '2021-07-20'
    notes:

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix preview URLs
        body: >-
          Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 that caused preview
          URLs to not work.

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix subnet discovery
        body: >-
          Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 where the Traffic
          Manager's <code>RoleBinding</code> did not correctly appoint
          the <code>traffic-manager</code> <code>Role</code>, causing
          subnet discovery to not be able to work correctly.
        docs: reference/rbac/

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix root-user configuration loading
        body: >-
          Fixed a regression introduced in 2.3.5 where the root daemon
          did not correctly read the configuration file; ignoring the
          user's configured log levels and timeouts.
        docs: reference/config/

      - type: bugfix
        title: Fix a user daemon crash
        body: >-
          Fixed an issue that could cause the user daemon to crash
          during shutdown, as during shutdown it unconditionally
          attempted to close a channel even though the channel might
          already be closed.

  - version: 2.3.5
    date: '2021-07-15'
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: traffic-manager in multiple namespaces
        body: >-
          We now support installing multiple traffic managers in the same cluster.
          This will allow operators to install deployments of telepresence that are
          limited to certain namespaces.
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.5-traffic-manager-namespaces.png
        docs: install/helm
      - type: feature
        title: No more dependence on kubectl
        body: >-
          Telepresence no longer depends on having an external
          <code>kubectl</code> binary, which might not be present for
          OpenShift users (who have <code>oc</code> instead of
          <code>kubectl</code>).
      - type: feature
        title: Agent image now configurable
        body: >-
          We now support configuring which agent image + registry to use in the
          config. This enables users whose laptop is an air-gapped environment to
          create selective intercepts without requiring a login. It also makes it easier
          for those who are developing on Telepresence to specify which agent image should
          be used. Env vars TELEPRESENCE_AGENT_IMAGE and TELEPRESENCE_REGISTRY are no longer
          used.
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.5-agent-config.png
        docs: reference/config/#images
      - type: feature
        title: Max gRPC receive size now configurable
        body: >-
          The default max size of messages received through gRPC (4 MB) is sometimes insufficient. It can now be configured.
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.5-grpc-max-receive-size.png
        docs: reference/config/#grpc
      - type: feature
        title: CLI can be used in air-gapped environments
        body: >-
          While Telepresence will auto-detect if your cluster is in an air-gapped environment,
          we've added an option users can add to their config.yml to ensure the cli acts like it
          is in an air-gapped environment. Air-gapped environments require a manually installed
          licence.
        docs: reference/cluster-config/#air-gapped-cluster
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.5-skipLogin.png
  - version: 2.3.4
    date: '2021-07-09'
    notes:
      - type: bugfix
        title: Improved IP log statements
        body: >-
          Some log statements were printing incorrect characters, when they should have been IP addresses.
          This has been resolved to include more accurate and useful logging.
        docs: reference/config/#log-levels
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.4-ip-error.png
      - type: bugfix
        title: Improved messaging when multiple services match a workload
        body: >-
          If multiple services matched a workload when performing an intercept, Telepresence would crash.
          It now gives the correct error message, instructing the user on how to specify which
          service the intercept should use.
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.4-improved-error.png
        docs: reference/intercepts
      - type: bugfix
        title: Traffic-manger creates services in its own namespace to determine subnet
        body: >-
          Telepresence will now determine the service subnet by creating a dummy-service in its own
          namespace, instead of the default namespace, which was causing RBAC permissions issues in
          some clusters.
        docs: reference/routing/#subnets
      - type: bugfix
        title: Telepresence connect respects pre-existing clusterrole
        body: >-
          When Telepresence connects, if the <code>traffic-manager</code>'s desired <code>clusterrole</code> already exists in the
          cluster, Telepresence will no longer try to update the clusterrole.
        docs: reference/rbac
      - type: bugfix
        title: Helm Chart fixed for clientRbac.namespaced
        body: >-
          The Telepresence Helm chart no longer fails when installing with <code>--set clientRbac.namespaced=true</code>.
        docs: install/helm
  - version: 2.3.3
    date: '2021-07-07'
    notes:
      - type: feature
        title: Traffic Manager Helm Chart
        body: >-
          Telepresence now supports installing the Traffic Manager via Helm.
          This will make it easy for operators to install and configure the
          server-side components of Telepresence separately from the CLI (which
          in turn allows for better separation of permissions).
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.3-helm.png
        docs: install/helm/
      - type: feature
        title: Traffic-manager in custom namespace
        body: >-
          As the <code>traffic-manager</code> can now be installed in any
          namespace via Helm, Telepresence can now be configured to look for the
          Traffic Manager in a namespace other than <code>ambassador</code>.
          This can be configured on a per-cluster basis.
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.3-namespace-config.png
        docs: reference/config
      - type: feature
        title: Intercept --to-pod
        body: >-
          <code>telepresence intercept</code> now supports a
          <code>--to-pod</code> flag that can be used to port-forward sidecars'
          ports from an intercepted pod.
        image: ./telepresence-2.3.3-to-pod.png
        docs: reference/intercepts
      - type: change
        title: Change in migration from edgectl
        body: >-
          Telepresence no longer automatically shuts down the old
          <code>api_version=1</code> <code>edgectl</code> daemon.  If migrating
          from such an old version of <code>edgectl</code> you must now manually
          shut down the <code>edgectl</code> daemon before running Telepresence.
          This was already the case when migrating from the newer
          <code>api_version=2</code> <code>edgectl</code>.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Fixed error during shutdown
        body: >-
          The root daemon no longer terminates when the user daemon disconnects
          from its gRPC streams, and instead waits to be terminated by the CLI.
          This could cause problems with things not being cleaned up correctly.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Intercepts will survive deletion of intercepted pod
        body: >-
          An intercept will survive deletion of the intercepted pod provided
          that another pod is created (or already exists) that can take over.
  - version: 2.3.2

      # Headliners
      - type: feature
        title: Service Port Annotation
        body: >-
          The mutator webhook for injecting traffic-agents now
          recognizes a
          <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/inject-service-port</code>
          annotation to specify which port to intercept; bringing the
          functionality of the <code>--port</code> flag to users who
          use the mutator webook in order to control Telepresence via
          GitOps.

        docs: reference/cluster-config#service-port-annotation
      - type: feature
        title: Outbound Connections
        body: >-
          Outbound connections are now routed through the intercepted
          Pods which means that the connections originate from that
          Pod from the cluster's perspective.  This allows service
          meshes to correctly identify the traffic.
        docs: reference/routing/#outbound
      - type: change
        title: Inbound Connections
        body: >-
          Inbound connections from an intercepted agent are now
          tunneled to the manager over the existing gRPC connection,
          instead of establishing a new connection to the manager for
          each inbound connection.  This avoids interference from
          certain service mesh configurations.
        docs: reference/routing/#inbound

      # RBAC changes
      - type: change
        title: Traffic Manager needs new RBAC permissions
        body: >-
          The Traffic Manager requires <a href="reference/rbac">RBAC
          permissions</a> to list Nodes, Pods, and to create a dummy
          Service in the manager's namespace.
        docs: reference/routing/#subnets
      - type: change
        title: Reduced developer RBAC requirements
        body: >-
          The on-laptop client no longer requires <a
          href="reference/rbac">RBAC permissions</a> to list the Nodes
          in the cluster or to create Services, as that functionality
          has been moved to the Traffic Manager.

      # Bugfixes
      - type: bugfix
        title: Able to detect subnets
        body: >-
          Telepresence will now detect the Pod CIDR ranges even if
          they are not listed in the Nodes.

        docs: reference/routing/#subnets
      - type: bugfix
        title: Dynamic IP ranges
        body: >-
          The list of cluster subnets that the virtual network
          interface will route is now configured dynamically and will
          follow changes in the cluster.
      - type: bugfix
        title: No duplicate subnets
        body: >-
          Subnets fully covered by other subnets are now pruned
          internally and thus never superfluously added to the
          laptop's routing table.
        docs: reference/routing/#subnets
      - type: change # not a bugfix, but it only makes sense to mention after the above bugfixes
        title: Change in default timeout
        body: >-
          The <code>trafficManagerAPI</code> timeout default has
          changed from 5 seconds to 15 seconds, in order to facilitate
          the extended time it takes for the traffic-manager to do its
          initial discovery of cluster info as a result of the above
          bugfixes.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Removal of DNS config files on macOS
        body: >-
          On macOS, files generated under
          <code>/etc/resolver/</code> as the result of using
          <code>include-suffixes</code> in the cluster config are now
          properly removed on quit.
        docs: reference/routing/#mac-os-resolver

      - type: bugfix
        title: Large file transfers
        body: >-
          Telepresence no longer erroneously terminates connections
          early when sending a large HTTP response from an intercepted
          service.
      - type: bugfix
        title: Race condition in shutdown
        body: >-
          When shutting down the user-daemon or root-daemon on the
          laptop, <code>telepresence quit</code> and related commands
          no longer return early before everything is fully shut down.
          Now it can be counted on that by the time the command has
          returned that all of the side-effects on the laptop have
          been cleaned up.

    notes:
      - title: DNS Resolver Configuration
        body: "Telepresence now supports per-cluster configuration for custom dns behavior, which will enable users to determine which local + remote resolver to use and which suffixes should be ignored + included. These can be configured on a per-cluster basis."

        body: "Telepresence now supports also proxying user-specified subnets so that they can access external services only accessible to the cluster while connected to Telepresence. These can be configured on a per-cluster basis and each subnet is added to the TUN device so that requests are routed to the cluster for IPs that fall within that subnet."

        body: "The Traffic Manager now contains a mutating webhook to automatically add an agent to pods that have the <code>telepresence.getambassador.io/traffic-agent: enabled</code> annotation.  This enables Telepresence to work well with GitOps CD platforms that rely on higher level kubernetes objects matching what is stored in git.  For workloads without the annotation, Telepresence will add the agent the way it has in the past"

The VIF is a layer 3 TUN-device that exists while Telepresence is connected. It makes the subnets in the cluster available to the workstation and will also route DNS requests to the cluster and forward them to intercepted pods. This means that pods with custom DNS configuration will work as expected. Prior versions of Telepresence would use firewall rules and were only capable of routing TCP."

This means that Telepresence no longer uses ssh tunnels and that the manager no longer have an <code>sshd</code> installed. Volume mounts are still established using <code>sshfs</code> but it is now configured to communicate using the sftp-protocol directly, which means that the traffic agent also runs without <code>sshd</code>. A desired side effect of this is that the manager and agent containers no longer need a special user configuration."
